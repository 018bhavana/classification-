Dataset:
The dataset contains the following fields: Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked.

Algorithm: 
1. Load the dataset from the specified file path.
2. Create a new column 'Survive'.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Initialize a different Classifiers.
5. Train the classifiers using the training data.
6. Make predictions on the test set.
7. Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
8. Print the results.
9. Plot the Confusion Matrix Heatmap.
10. Plot the Precision-Recall Curve.
12. Plot a Bar plot of Accuracy, Precision, and Recall.
